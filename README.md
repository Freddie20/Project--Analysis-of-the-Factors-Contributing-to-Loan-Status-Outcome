# Project--Analysis-of-the-Factors-Contributing-to-Loan-Status-Outcome

Dataset
The Loan data by Prosper contains 113,937 observations with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.

For this analysis I worked on 14 variables from the data namely Term, LoanStatus, BorrowerAPR, BorrowerRate, ListingCategory, BorrowerState, EmploymentStatus, IsBorrowerHomeowner, CreditScore, DebtToIncomeRatio, IncomeRange, LoanOriginalAmount, Recommendations and Investors.

I was most interested to answer 'what factors affect a loanâ€™s outcome status in the dataset?'


Conclusion
Based on my analysis, the factors that affect a loan's outcome are BorrowerRate, EmploymentStatus, IsBorrowerHomeowner, and Investors.
